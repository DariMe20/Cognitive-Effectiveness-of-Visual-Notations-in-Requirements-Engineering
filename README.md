# Cognitive Effectiveness of Visual Notations in Requirements Engineering

This project, developed during my Master's in **Business Modeling and Distributed Computing** at BabeÈ™-Bolyai University, presents a comparative framework for evaluating visual notations in Requirements Engineering.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The study evaluates **i\***, **KAOS**, **UML**, and **BPMN** using the **Physics of Notations (PoN)** framework. Five principles are analyzed:
- Semiotic Clarity
- Perceptual Discriminability
- Semantic Transparency
- Visual Expressiveness
- Graphic Economy

## ðŸ”Ž Key Results
- **BPMN** achieved the highest cognitive effectiveness across all principles.  
- **KAOS** performed well in graphic economy but had limited transparency.  
- **UML** offered flexibility yet suffered from symbol overload.  
- **i\*** struggled with clarity and discriminability but showed good visual expressiveness.
